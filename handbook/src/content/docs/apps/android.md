The Android app lives in `Apps/Android/`. It is an early phone shell: pairing,
HEVC live view, GPU looks, scopes, camera writes, and media. It is **not on
Google Play yet**. Join the closed-beta waitlist on
[openpocketcine.app](https://openpocketcine.app/). iOS is the daily driver.

## How Swift reaches Android

Business logic stays in `OpenPocketViewCore`. Android follows the OpenZCine
pattern, not Skip/SKIE:

1. Portable Swift core (no SwiftUI, UIKit, or Android imports).
2. `OpenPocketCineAndroidFacade` — session + hand-written JNI (`@_cdecl`).
3. Gradle `:app:stageSwiftCore` (`just android-core`) builds
   `aarch64-unknown-linux-android29` and stages `libOpenPocketCineAndroid.so`.
   **arm64-v8a only.** Toolchain pin: Swift **6.3.3**.
4. Kotlin `core-api` wraps JNI. Kotlin does not pack protocol bytes.

Build recipes: [Setup](../guides/setup/). The living JNI/I/O notes:
[`ANDROID.md`](https://github.com/erik-sutton95/OpenPocketCine/blob/main/ANDROID.md).

## Operator surface

Chrome, assists, capture, Operator Setup, and media are meant to match iOS.
Exceptions (Frame.io, MetalFX, iOS 26 Liquid Glass, …) are listed in
[`docs/PARITY.md`](https://github.com/erik-sutton95/OpenPocketCine/blob/main/docs/PARITY.md).

Live picture: Vulkan when the device can init it; GLES fallback. HUD liquid
glass is Kyant on API 33+ / ≥4 GB; older or low-RAM devices stay on solid frost.

Wi-Fi passwords stay in Keystore, not saved-camera JSON. Pairing and live view
need a **physical** Android phone.

## What not to copy from OpenZCine Android

Nikon PTP-IP, AccessorySetupKit, OCR SSID scanner, USB-C/HDMI paths.
